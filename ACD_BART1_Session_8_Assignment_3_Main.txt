     Problem Statement

1. A recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a
      source in at least one of their term papers. Let X equal the number of students in a random sample of
      size n = 31 who have used Wikipedia as a source.

Perform the below functions

a.     Find the probability that X is equal to 17
Answer:
> dbinom(17, size = 31, prob = 0.447)
[1] 0.07532248
> 

b.     Find the probability that X is at most 13
Answer:
> pbinom(13, size = 31, prob = 0.447)
[1] 0.451357
> 

c.     Find the probability that X is bigger than 11.
Answer:
> pbinom(11, size = 31, prob = 0.447, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 0.8020339
> 

d.     Find the probability that X is at least 15.
Answer:
> pbinom(14, size = 31, prob = 0.447, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 0.406024
> 

e.     Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19, inclusive
Answer:
> sum(dbinom(16:19, size = 31, prob = 0.447))
[1] 0.2544758
> diff(pbinom(c(19, 15), size = 31, prob = 0.447, lower.tail = FALSE))
[1] 0.2544758
